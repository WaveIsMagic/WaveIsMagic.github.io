## The developers of **[Effort.jl emulator](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2025/09/044)** have managed to enable simulation of large scale structures of the Universe in typical hardware in laptops

*"The emulator doesn't "understand" the physics itself: it knows the theoretical model's responses very well and can anticipate what it would output for a new input. Effort.jl's originality is that it further reduces the training phase by building into the algorithm knowledge we already have about how predictions change when parameters change: instead of making the network "re-learn" these, it uses them from the start."*
