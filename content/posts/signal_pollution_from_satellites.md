### SpaceX satellites operated by US government under ["Starshield" network](https://spaceflightnow.com/2025/04/19/live-coverage-spacex-to-launch-third-nro-mission-in-eight-days/) are leaking radio signals in protected frequency range 
It is ironic that a feat made possible by scientific progress is now limiting the frontiers of science; and it is a mark of humanity to create a pile of waste near it's existence. At the moment, humanity is going beyond our atmosphere to leave this mark. 

We have known for some time that space debris comprising of disposed material from satellites in orbit, or components of destroyed/decommissioned satellites themselves are becoming a [topic of risk](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-space-junk-and-why-is-it-a-problem.html) for other satellites. Humans have now added waves alongside such particle pollutants. In an act of defiance, egotism, negligence, and carelessness, the SpaceX satellites continue to leak radio signals and pollute the signal spectrum around Earth. NASA recognized citizen scientist [Scott Tilley](http://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meet-a-citizen-scientist-scott-tilley/) discovered Strong S-Band Emissions from the Starshield Constellation and describes the signals and regulatory context in [his paper](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17373140) pending peer review.

In this [Live Science report](https://www.livescience.com/space/space-exploration/secretive-spacex-satellites-operated-by-us-government-are-shooting-disruptive-radio-signals-into-space-astronomer-accidentally-discovers), a radio astronomer at the Max Planck Institute of Radio Astronomy in Germany, [Benjamin Winkel](https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/person/27866/145960), mentioned "These signals seem to be intentionally emitted by Starshield satellites, but outside of permitted frequency ranges".
